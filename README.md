# NEWS FLASH 24/05/2016

First I want to apologies to all of you, the users of Blogify. I started this project
for my final school project and I let you all down after it because of my new job that took all 
of my time.

But GREATE news from today on I will start merging the package over to Laravel 5.2 and I will make sure 
that you can use it again.

Want to help? Feel free to make a PR with the merged code.

Blogify is a package to add a blog to your Laravel 5 application. It comes with a full admin panel with different views for all user roles.
You can generate the public part through an artisan command but feel free to customize it, or just create your own using or models and their scopes.
