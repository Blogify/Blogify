# Blogify will no longer be maintained

Due to the fact that there are better alternatives on the market and a lack of time I will no longer
maintain the Blogify package. There will be no more updates or new releases.
You can still use the current versions, the repo will not run away. 

If you want to take over the project, please contact me via email, twitter, ..?

Blogify is a package to add a blog to your Laravel 5 application. It comes with a full admin panel with different views for all user roles.
You can generate the public part through an artisan command but feel free to customize it, or just create your own using or models and their scopes.
